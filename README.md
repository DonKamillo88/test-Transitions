Attached is the test. It's a zip containing a video outlining the kind of animation we're looking for, as well as a Sketch file with the designs.
There's a video included of how we would like the interaction to look, basically the important thing is the card closed to open and back animation. 
The background behind the card can just be a solid colour (i.e. don't worry about blur), simply try and nail that transition.
